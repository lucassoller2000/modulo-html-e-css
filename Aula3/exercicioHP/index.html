				<h2>THE PHILOSOPHER STONE</h2>
				<p>
					Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
					that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last
					people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,
					because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.
					Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made
					drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did
					have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had
					nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she
					spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
					neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their
					opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
					The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and
					their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't
					think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.
					Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;
					in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her
					sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was
					possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would
					say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the
					Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy
					was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want
					Dudley mixing with a child like.

						Harry Potter is an ordinary boy who lives in a cupboard under the stairs at his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon's house, which he thinks is normal for someone like him who's parents have been killed in a â€˜car crash'. He is bullied by them and his fat, spoilt cousin Dudley, and lives a very unremarkable life with only the odd hiccup (like his hair growing back overnight!) to cause him much to think about. That is until an owl turns up with a letter addressed to Harry and all hell breaks

						But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something

						funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this

				<span id="primary-letter">H</span>ypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and 
				web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of 
				cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.
			</p>
			<p>
				Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the 
				documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically 
				and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
			</p>
			<p>
				HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other 
				objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means 
				to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, 
				paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, 
				written using angle brackets. Tags such as <mark><<span>img/></mark>
				and <mark><<span>input/></mark> directly introduce content into the 
				page. Other tags such as <mark><<span>p>...<<span>p/></mark> 
				surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. 
				Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
			</p>
			<p>
				HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the 
				behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. 
				The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has 
				encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1980, physicist <span id="name-decoration">Tim Berners-Lee</span>, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a 
				system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo 
				proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser 
				and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert 
				Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted 
				by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext 
				is used" and put an encyclopedia first.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, 
				which in 1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a 
				standard against which future implementations should be based.
